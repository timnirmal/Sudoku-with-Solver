# Sudoku Puzzle Generator and Solver

This project contain,
  1. Generator code in **Generator.h**
  2. Recursive Solving Algorithm in **Solver.h**
  3. Non-Recursive Solving method in **Solver3.h**
  4. Solve with user inputs in same **Solve3.h**

In method 3 and 4, First the answer of the code is saved to array.
Then comapre with the solutions genereted by algorithm or user inputs.

For method 2 this is not requred. It solve the code by itself.
